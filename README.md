# FoodSearcher

We are creating a fitness website that will show our users what activities they need to do to burn the calories of whatever meal they eat and for how long. 

Here is how the website will work:
1) User searches for the food that they ate
2) An API finds results for recipes that may match what they are searching for (i.e. if user types 'chicken', baked chicken, fried chicken, chiken tenders, chicken nuggets will show up)
3) Once they select the correct meal, information that includes nutrition facts and calories of the meal will show up
4) Then the site will offer a few options of how the user would like to lose the calories
5) After the user chooses an activity, a second API tells them how long to do the option in order to lose the previously stated calories.
